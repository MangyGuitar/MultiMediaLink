# MultiMediaLink

MultiMediaLink is a versatile Minecraft plugin that allows you to easily display custom text and links within the game. With MultiMediaLink, players can access relevant information by using simple commands. For example, using "/discord" will display the link to the Discord server, and using "/twitter" will show the server's Twitter username.

The plugin's configuration is done through the config.yml file, enabling you to customize the texts and links according to your needs. You can edit the file to add your own messages and links to social media platforms, websites, or any other resources important for your server.

MultiMediaLink is a practical tool for sharing key information with players and keeping them connected to your communication channels. Make the most of this tool to enhance the player experience and encourage active participation on your server.
